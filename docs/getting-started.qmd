## Prerequisites

Before diving into Logic Quest, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.13+**: The game requires Python 3.13 or later
- **uv package manager**: Fast Python package manager for dependency management

### Installing uv

If you don't have uv installed, you can install it using:

```bash
# On macOS/Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# On Windows
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

# Or with pip
pip install uv
```

## Installation

1. **Clone or download the project**
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. **Run the web application**:
   ```bash
   reflex run
   
   # Alternative: Run with Python directly
   python main.py
   ```

   This will start a local web server (typically at http://localhost:3000) where you can access the game through your browser.

   **Note**: The application is configured as "prologresurrected" in the Reflex configuration, with optimized state management for smooth web performance. Both entry points provide the same functionality.

## Development Setup

If you want to contribute or modify the game:

### Using Task Runner (Recommended)

Install [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) for streamlined development:

```bash
# Show all available commands
task

# Set up development environment
task setup

# Run tests
task test

# Run linting and formatting
task lint

# Run all validation checks
task validate
```

### Direct Commands

```bash
# Run unit tests
uv run pytest tests/ -v

# Run linting
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format .

# Demo validation utilities
task demo
```

## First Run

When you first start Logic Quest in your web browser, you'll see:

1. **Welcome Screen**: Cyberpunk-styled interface with ASCII art and neon colors
2. **Tutorial Option**: "Start Hello World Tutorial" button for beginners
3. **Main Adventure**: "Begin Main Adventure" button for the full experience
4. **Full-Height Terminal Interface**: Optimized terminal layout that uses the entire browser viewport with authentic 80s styling and multi-color text support (green, cyan, yellow, red, white)

### Recommended Path

For beginners, we recommend starting with the **Hello World Tutorial**:

- Learn basic Prolog syntax step-by-step
- Practice creating facts and writing queries
- Get comfortable with the terminal interface
- Build confidence before tackling advanced concepts

### Navigation

- **Click buttons**: Navigate between game modes and options
- **Type commands**: Interact with the terminal interface
- **Enter key**: Submit commands in the terminal
- **Web interface**: Full browser-based experience with responsive design

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Command not found: uv"**
- Make sure uv is installed and in your PATH
- Try restarting your terminal after installation

**"Python version not supported"**
- Ensure you have Python 3.13 or later installed
- Check with: `python --version`

**"Module not found" errors**
- Run `uv sync` to install all dependencies
- Make sure you're in the project directory

**"Port already in use" or server won't start**
- Another application may be using port 3000
- Try stopping other development servers
- Reflex will automatically find an available port

**Browser shows blank page or connection refused**
- Make sure the Reflex server is running (`reflex run`)
- Check the terminal for any error messages
- Try refreshing the browser or clearing cache
- Ensure your firewall isn't blocking the connection

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. Check that all prerequisites are installed
2. Verify you're in the correct directory
3. Try running `task setup` to reset the environment
4. Check the project's issue tracker for known problems
