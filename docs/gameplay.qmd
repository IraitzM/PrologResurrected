### Advanced Error Handling & Validation

The game provides comprehensive error handling with progressive learning support:

#### Progressive Hint System
- **5 Escalating Levels**: From gentle encouragement to complete solutions
- **Intelligent Error Detection**: Automatic categorization of common Prolog syntax mistakes
- **Contextual Guidance**: Hints tailored to specific error types and exercises
- **Attempt-Based Progression**: More specific help as users make more attempts

#### Specific Error Messages
- **Missing Period Errors**: Clear guidance when facts/queries lack required periods
- **Capitalization Issues**: Help with predicate and variable capitalization rules
- **Parentheses Problems**: Detection and guidance for missing or mismatched parentheses
- **Query Syntax**: Specific help with `?-` prefix and query formatting
- **Pattern Recognition**: Comprehensive detection of malformed Prolog syntax

#### Recovery Mechanisms for Stuck Users
- **Multiple Help Options**: Continue, get hints, see examples, show answers, skip exercises
- **Alternative Explanations**: Different ways to understand the same concept
- **Adaptive Support**: More recovery options become available after multiple attempts
- **Concept Review**: Quick refreshers on key Prolog concepts when needed

#### Color-Coded Feedback
- ✅ **Valid syntax**: Green confirmation with parsed components
- ❌ **Syntax errors**: Red error messages with specific, encouraging hints
- 💡 **Progressive hints**: Yellow encouraging messages with escalating specificity
- 🔵 **System messages**: Cyan text for commands and system responses
- ⚪ **General text**: White text for neutral information
- 🎯 **Recovery options**: Highlighted help options for stuck users

### Example Interactions

**Creating a fact:**
```prolog
LOGIC-1 > likes(alice, chocolate).
✅ Valid fact! Predicate: likes, Arguments: [alice, chocolate]
```

**Writing a query:**
```prolog
LOGIC-1 > ?- likes(alice, X).
✅ Valid query! This will find what Alice likes.
```

**Progressive error handling:**
```prolog
# First attempt - gentle hint
LOGIC-1 > likes(alice, chocolate)
❌ Missing period at the end.
💡 Don't forget the period (.) at the end!

# Second attempt - more specific
LOGIC-1 > likes(alice, chocolate)
❌ Missing period at the end.
💡 All Prolog facts must end with a period (.).
🔍 Remember the pattern: predicate(argument1, argument2).

# Third attempt - detailed guidance
LOGIC-1 > likes(alice, chocolate)
❌ Missing period at the end.
💡 The period tells Prolog that your statement is complete.
📝 Let's check your syntax step by step:
   1. Does it start with a lowercase predicate? ✅
   2. Are the arguments in parentheses? ✅
   3. Are arguments separated by commas? ✅
   4. Does it end with a period (.)? ❌

# Recovery options after multiple attempts
🤔 You've made several attempts. What would you like to do?
1. Keep trying (I can do this!)
2. Give me a more specific hint
3. Show me a similar example
4. Show me the correct answer
5. Skip this exercise for now
```

## Tips for Success

### For Beginners

1. **Start with the tutorial**: Don't skip the Hello World introduction
2. **Read error messages carefully**: They contain valuable learning hints
3. **Experiment freely**: The system is forgiving and educational
4. **Use hints when stuck**: They're designed to teach, not just solve
5. **Take your time**: Understanding is more important than speed

### For Experienced Programmers

1. **Embrace the logic paradigm**: Prolog thinks differently than imperative languages
2. **Focus on declarative thinking**: Describe what you want, not how to get it
3. **Practice pattern matching**: It's fundamental to Prolog's power
4. **Understand backtracking**: Learn how Prolog explores solution spaces
5. **Master recursion**: It's the key to solving complex logical problems

### General Strategy

- **Read the story**: Context helps understand the technical concepts
- **Practice regularly**: Consistent engagement builds understanding
- **Don't rush**: Take time to understand each concept thoroughly
- **Ask for hints**: They're educational tools, not cheating
- **Review your progress**: Use the stats to identify areas for improvement
