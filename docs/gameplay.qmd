## Game Overview

Logic Quest combines education with adventure in a retro cyberpunk setting. You'll progress through different memory banks of the LOGIC-1 AI system, each teaching core Prolog concepts through interactive puzzles.

## Game Structure

### Tutorial Mode: Hello World Prolog

Perfect for beginners, the tutorial covers:

1. **Introduction**: What is Prolog and logic programming?
2. **Facts**: Creating statements of truth
3. **Fact Creation**: Hands-on practice writing your first fact
4. **Queries**: Asking questions with Prolog syntax
5. **Variables**: Using variables to find multiple solutions
6. **Completion**: Summary and next steps

### Main Adventure: Memory Bank Restoration

The full game consists of 5 levels, each focusing on a key Prolog concept:

- **Level 1 - Facts Database**: Restore basic knowledge
- **Level 2 - Inference Engine**: Repair logical rules
- **Level 3 - Pattern Matching**: Fix unification systems
- **Level 4 - Search Algorithms**: Restore backtracking
- **Level 5 - Recursive Core**: Master recursive problem solving

## Interface Guide

### Web-Based Terminal Interface

Logic Quest runs in your web browser with an authentic retro terminal experience:

- **Welcome Screen**: Cyberpunk-styled main menu with ASCII art
- **Interactive Buttons**: Click to navigate between game modes
- **Full-Height Terminal Display**: Optimized layout that uses the entire browser viewport with fixed header and input areas
- **Enhanced Terminal Output**: Multi-color terminal output with proper color coding, automatic scrolling, and robust error handling
- **Terminal Window**: Type commands and see responses in real-time with responsive height adjustment
- **Educational Content Boxes**: Centered explanation boxes with retro styling for displaying learning materials and concept explanations
- **Defensive Programming**: Safe array bounds checking ensures stable terminal rendering without errors
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile browsers with dynamic layout calculations
- **Optimized Performance**: Lazy-loaded game components for smooth interaction
- **Real-time State Management**: Instant updates without page refreshes

### Terminal Commands

Once in the game terminal, use these commands:

```
LOGIC-1 > help              # Show available commands
LOGIC-1 > next              # Continue tutorial or story
LOGIC-1 > menu              # Return to main menu
LOGIC-1 > status            # Check progress and stats
LOGIC-1 > hint              # Get a hint for current puzzle
```

### Navigation

- **Main Menu**: Click buttons to start tutorial or adventure
- **Terminal Input**: Type commands and press Enter
- **Browser Controls**: Use browser back/forward if needed
- **Responsive Layout**: Interface adapts to your screen size

### Input Validation

The game provides real-time feedback on your Prolog syntax with color-coded messages:

- ✅ **Valid syntax**: Green confirmation with parsed components
- ❌ **Syntax errors**: Red error messages with specific hints
- 💡 **Helpful suggestions**: Yellow encouraging messages to keep you motivated
- 🔵 **System messages**: Cyan text for commands and system responses
- ⚪ **General text**: White text for neutral information

### Example Interactions

**Creating a fact:**
```prolog
LOGIC-1 > likes(alice, chocolate).
✅ Valid fact! Predicate: likes, Arguments: [alice, chocolate]
```

**Writing a query:**
```prolog
LOGIC-1 > ?- likes(alice, X).
✅ Valid query! This will find what Alice likes.
```

**Handling errors:**
```prolog
LOGIC-1 > likes(alice, chocolate)
❌ Missing period at the end.
💡 All Prolog facts must end with a period (.).
```

## Progression System

### Scoring

Your performance is tracked across multiple dimensions:

- **Puzzle Score**: Based on attempts and hints used
- **Speed Bonus**: Faster completion earns extra points
- **Accuracy Rating**: Fewer mistakes improve your rating
- **Concept Mastery**: Track which Prolog concepts you've learned

### Progress Tracking

The game maintains detailed statistics:

- Facts and queries you've created
- Mistakes made and lessons learned
- Time spent on each concept
- Overall completion percentage

### Difficulty Scaling

Puzzles adapt to your skill level:

- **Beginner**: Step-by-step guidance with detailed hints
- **Intermediate**: Less hand-holding, more complex scenarios
- **Advanced**: Multi-step problems requiring deeper understanding
- **Expert**: Open-ended challenges testing mastery

## Learning Features

### Interactive Validation

Every input is validated with educational feedback:

- **Syntax checking**: Immediate feedback on Prolog grammar
- **Semantic analysis**: Verify logical correctness
- **Helpful hints**: Specific suggestions for common mistakes
- **Encouraging messages**: Supportive feedback to maintain motivation

### Contextual Help

Get assistance tailored to your current situation:

- **Concept explanations**: Clear descriptions of Prolog features
- **Example solutions**: See correct syntax in action
- **Progressive hints**: Start gentle, get more specific if needed
- **Error analysis**: Understand why something doesn't work

### Practice Exercises

Reinforce learning with hands-on practice:

- **Guided exercises**: Step-by-step practice with immediate feedback
- **Free exploration**: Experiment with concepts in a safe environment
- **Challenge problems**: Test your understanding with complex scenarios
- **Review sessions**: Revisit concepts you've learned

## Tips for Success

### For Beginners

1. **Start with the tutorial**: Don't skip the Hello World introduction
2. **Read error messages carefully**: They contain valuable learning hints
3. **Experiment freely**: The system is forgiving and educational
4. **Use hints when stuck**: They're designed to teach, not just solve
5. **Take your time**: Understanding is more important than speed

### For Experienced Programmers

1. **Embrace the logic paradigm**: Prolog thinks differently than imperative languages
2. **Focus on declarative thinking**: Describe what you want, not how to get it
3. **Practice pattern matching**: It's fundamental to Prolog's power
4. **Understand backtracking**: Learn how Prolog explores solution spaces
5. **Master recursion**: It's the key to solving complex logical problems

### General Strategy

- **Read the story**: Context helps understand the technical concepts
- **Practice regularly**: Consistent engagement builds understanding
- **Don't rush**: Take time to understand each concept thoroughly
- **Ask for hints**: They're educational tools, not cheating
- **Review your progress**: Use the stats to identify areas for improvement
