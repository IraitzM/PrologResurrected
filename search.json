    "section": "Core Concepts Covered",
    "text": "Core Concepts Covered\n\n1. Facts - The Foundation of Knowledge\nWhat are Facts? Facts are unconditional statements of truth in Prolog. They represent basic knowledge about the world.\nSyntax:\npredicate(argument1, argument2, ...).\nExamples:\nlikes(alice, chocolate).\nparent(tom, bob).\nemployee(sarah, tech_corp).\ncolor(grass, green).\nKey Learning Points: - Facts always end with a period (.) - Predicate names start with lowercase letters - Arguments can be atoms, numbers, or variables - Facts form the knowledge base of your program\n\n\n2. Queries - Asking Questions\nWhat are Queries? Queries are questions you ask Prolog about the facts and rules in your knowledge base.\nSyntax:\n?- predicate(argument1, argument2, ...).\nExamples:\n?- likes(alice, chocolate).     % Does Alice like chocolate?\n?- parent(tom, bob).            % Is Tom Bob's parent?\n?- employee(sarah, tech_corp).  % Does Sarah work at Tech Corp?\nKey Learning Points: - Queries start with ?- - Prolog answers “yes” (true) or “no” (false) - Queries can test existing knowledge - They form the basis for more complex reasoning\n\n\n3. Variables - Finding Multiple Solutions\nWhat are Variables? Variables in Prolog start with uppercase letters and can match any value. They allow you to find multiple solutions to queries.\nSyntax:\n?- predicate(Variable, argument).\n?- predicate(X, Y).\nExamples:\n?- likes(alice, X).        % What does Alice like?\n?- likes(Person, pizza).   % Who likes pizza?\n?- parent(X, Y).           % Find all parent-child relationships\nKey Learning Points: - Variables start with uppercase letters (X, Person, Thing) - They can match any value in the knowledge base - One query can return multiple solutions - Variables enable pattern matching and discovery\n\n\n4. Rules - Logical Implications\nWhat are Rules? Rules define logical relationships and allow Prolog to derive new knowledge from existing facts.\nSyntax:\nhead :- body.\nconclusion :- condition1, condition2.\nExamples:\ngrandparent(X, Z) :- parent(X, Y), parent(Y, Z).\nhappy(X) :- likes(X, chocolate), sunny(today).\nsibling(X, Y) :- parent(Z, X), parent(Z, Y), X \\= Y.\nKey Learning Points: - Rules have a head (conclusion) and body (conditions) - The :- symbol means “if” or “is true when” - Commas in the body mean “and” - Rules enable logical deduction and inference\n\n\n5. Unification - Pattern Matching\nWhat is Unification? Unification is Prolog’s method of matching patterns and binding variables to values.\nHow it Works: - Prolog tries to match query patterns with facts/rules - Variables get bound to specific values during matching - Complex structures can be unified recursively\nExamples:\n% Fact: person(alice, 25, programmer)\n% Query: ?- person(Name, Age, Job).\n% Result: Name = alice, Age = 25, Job = programmer\n\n% Fact: likes(bob, food(pizza, italian))\n% Query: ?- likes(bob, food(X, italian)).\n% Result: X = pizza\nKey Learning Points: - Unification happens automatically during query resolution - Variables get bound to make patterns match - Complex data structures can be unified - Understanding unification is key to Prolog mastery\n\n\n6. Backtracking - Exploring Alternatives\nWhat is Backtracking? Backtracking is Prolog’s systematic method of exploring all possible solutions to a query.\nHow it Works: 1. Try the first matching fact/rule 2. If it leads to success, report the solution 3. If it fails, backtrack and try the next alternative 4. Continue until all possibilities are exhausted\nExample:\n% Facts:\nlikes(alice, chocolate).\nlikes(alice, ice_cream).\nlikes(bob, pizza).\n\n% Query: ?- likes(alice, X).\n% Solutions found through backtracking:\n% X = chocolate ;\n% X = ice_cream\nKey Learning Points: - Prolog automatically explores all possible solutions - Backtracking enables finding multiple answers - It’s fundamental to Prolog’s search strategy - Understanding backtracking helps predict program behavior\n\n\n7. Recursion - Elegant Problem Solving\nWhat is Recursion in Prolog? Recursion allows rules to refer to themselves, enabling elegant solutions to complex problems.\nStructure:\n% Base case - stops the recursion\npredicate(base_condition).\n\n% Recursive case - calls itself with simpler input\npredicate(input) :- \n    condition,\n    predicate(simpler_input).\nClassic Example - Ancestor Relationship:\n% Base case: parent is an ancestor\nancestor(X, Y) :- parent(X, Y).\n\n% Recursive case: ancestor of ancestor\nancestor(X, Z) :- \n    parent(X, Y), \n    ancestor(Y, Z).\nKey Learning Points: - Always define a base case to stop recursion - Recursive case should work toward the base case - Recursion enables processing of arbitrary-depth structures - It’s essential for many Prolog algorithms"

Predicate: likes, Arguments: [alice, chocolate]\nWriting a query:\nLOGIC-1 &gt; ?- likes(alice, X).\n✅ Valid query! This will find what Alice likes.\nProgressive error handling:\n# First attempt - gentle hint\nLOGIC-1 &gt; likes(alice, chocolate)\n❌ Missing period at the end.\n💡 Don't forget the period (.) at the end!\n\n# Second attempt - more specific\nLOGIC-1 &gt; likes(alice, chocolate)\n❌ Missing period at the end.\n💡 All Prolog facts must end with a period (.).\n🔍 Remember the pattern: predicate(argument1, argument2).\n\n# Third attempt - detailed guidance\nLOGIC-1 &gt; likes(alice, chocolate)\n❌ Missing period at the end.\n💡 The period tells Prolog that your statement is complete.\n📝 Let's check your syntax step by step:\n   1. Does it start with a lowercase predicate? ✅\n   2. Are the arguments in parentheses? ✅\n   3. Are arguments separated by commas? ✅\n   4. Does it end with a period (.)? ❌\n\n# Recovery options after multiple attempts\n🤔 You've made several attempts. What would you like to do?\n1. Keep trying (I can do this!)\n2. Give me a more specific hint\n3. Show me a similar example\n4. Show me the correct answer\n5. Skip this exercise for now"
